Investigations: CT head 2017 collier in situ plus low density right temporal lobe  I reviewed this 57 year old man in clinic today. He continues to have what he calls \u201cabsences\u201d which are focal seizures. During them, he has a smell which is difficult to describe. He will lose awareness for a couple of minutes. When he has the warning of an unusual smell he will sit down. He injured his right elbow in a seizure last year.  As he is continuing to have seizures, I suggest that he increases the lamotrigine slowly by 25 mg every fortnight, to an initial dose of 100 mg twice a day. If he has no side-effects with this, then he can again continue to increases the lamotrigine by no more than 25 mg every fortnight.  I will see him again in around six months time, should there be a problem before then he can contact my secretary on the number above.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "152", "end_index": "181", "text": "lamotrigine 75 mg twice a day", "attributes": {"DrugName": "lamotrigine", "DrugDose": "75", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Dear Dr,  Diagnosis: focal epilepsy-Probable temporal Current antiepileptic medication:   carbamazepine   400 mg twice a day   Topiramate 100 mg BD    I revealed this 42 year old lady together with her husband in clinic today.

His main issue is migraines which occur around 3 times per month. They are very stereotyped and consist of severe headache with nausea and photophobia. Things are quite stable from an epilepsy point of view. As you know he is taking 150 mg of   lamotrigine   twice a day. His last   seizures   were in his teenage years where he probably had around 3 or 4 focal to bilateral convulsive seizures. There were some perinatal problems and he was born to a long and traumatic labour. He had to spend around 2 weeks in Special care baby Unit. He had 4 febrile   seizures   at the age of 3, 4 and then around five. He had some viral meningitis when he was in his late teenage years while he was doing a levels.  He had an MRI brain performed in 2016. This does show some left-sided cortical and deep white matter changes which are probably representative of a perinatal insult.  Comments: In terms of his migraine and I would try acute treatment with high-dose ibuprofen or dispersible aspirin together with a Triptan. If this is not successful then I would consider preventative treatment such as propranolol or possibly tompiramate given his epilepsy. Otherwise as things are relatively stable from an epilepsy point I would leave his epilepsy treatment as it is.  yours  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "432", "end_index": "444", "text": "lamotrigine ", "attributes": {"DrugName": "Lamotrigine", "DrugDose": "150", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Diagnosis: Temporal lobe epilepsy  Seizure type and frequency: F  ocal seizures with altered awarenes  s approximately 1 per fortnight   Focal to bilateral   convulsive seizur  e  s, last event around Christmas 2017  Current antiepileptic medication:   eslicarbazepine  , 800 mg once a day   Zonisamide 75 mg twice a day    Previous antiepileptic medications tried: include lamotrigine, carbamazepine, levetiracetam  I reviewed this 41-year-old man together with his partner in clinic today.

Mr John John Jones D.O.B.: 20/10/1996  Diagnosis: probable focal onset epilepsy Anxiety Episodic migraine    Current medication levetiracetam 750mg twice a day (to change as detailed below)   Dispersible aspirin and triptans for migraine  I reviewed this 22 year old man together with his partner in clinic today. He has previously been treated by dr Richins for his epilepsy. To recount the history: at the age of 19 whilst at college: he suddenly felt lightheaded and felt strange before blacking out. He woke up in the ambulance and was taken to hospital where sodium valproate was started. He continued to get similar episodes whenever he forgot to take his medication.  With hindsight, Mr Jones\u2019s probably got similar events when he was a teenager. He continues to get episodes every week. During these episodes he feels \u201cOut of his body\u201d, is trapped and is unable to move. Before episodes of complete loss of consciousness he has the same\u201dout of his body\u201d feeling. Unfortunately, he put on a great deal of weight with the sodium valproate and so it was switched to the levetiracetam. He does feel as if his mood is not what it used to be but it is difficult to know if this is down to the medication or not.  Mr Jones had 2 febrile seizures at the age of 12 and 18 months. He was born slightly prematurely at 34 weeks. He has never had any significant head injuries. He has not had meningitis or encephalitis. His mother\u2019s brother has epilepsy and is taking lamotrigne. He currently smokes 20 cigarettes per day and some cannabis on the weekend. He binge drinks 20 pints of lager on most weekends but doesn\u2019t drink alcohol during the week.  I note the Normal MRI in 2017. Two previous EEGs have shown left-sided sharpened waveforms which are suspicious.  Impression: I think on balance these are epileptic seizures given the sterotyped nature of the \u201cout of body\u201d experiences. There have probably been focal to bilateral convulsive seizures as well.  Comments: As Mr Jones is getting some potential mood effects from the levetiracetam I suggest changing to Brivaracetam at a dose of 75 mg twice a day. I will ask our epilepsy nurse specialists to contact Mr Jones. I will review him again in four months time but he can contact our helpline should he have any problems before then.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "144", "end_index": "224", "text": "Current medication levetiracetam 750mg twice a day (to change as detailed below)", "attributes": {"DrugName": "levetiracetam", "DrugDose": "750", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 10th June 2018  Re.

I was pleased to hear that he has felt generally better since switching from Levetiracetam to Brivaracetam. He feels more alert. His   focal seizures now happen around once or twice per month  .  We went over potential triggers for his seizures including sleep deprivation and alcohol consumption. We discussed the DVLA rules about driving. He is keen to learn to drive. I explained that he needs to be a year free of seizures before he is eligible to play again.  I suggest increasing the brivaracetam to 100 mg in the morning and 75 mg in the evening for one month then if necessary increasing again to hundred mg twice a day after this. If he is still getting seizures in my next clinic review we can think of adding in an additional medication such as lamotrigine.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "141", "end_index": "189", "text": "Current medication Brivaracetam 75mg twice a day", "attributes": {"DrugName": "brivaracetam", "DrugDose": "75", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 10th December 2019  Re.

I was pleased to hear that she has not had any further seizures since her last clinic appointment and since starting the lamotrigine. We had a chat of the ongoing need to take medication. This is because of the risks that convulsive seizures have. I explained that the EEG changes, which show a generalised pattern, are in keeping with the syndrome of a generalised epilepsy with tonic clonic seizures alone. I explained that the EEG also showed evidence of photosensitivity. This means that Miss Clark should be careful around flashing lights and patterns of sunlight through trees which may provoke seizures    .

He was unconscious and in hospital for a week at the time. He has been left with left sided weakness since the accident. He also has ongoing problems with his mood and has seen the community mental health team for this.   On 23rd September 2019 he remembers having unusual episodes of a strange \u201cout of body\u201d experience. He has several of these in the morning and then had another one in the afternoon before loosing consciousness. The next thing he remembers is waking up in hospital. He has not had any further events.

Although most seizures are uneventful sometimes seizures can cause injury and very rarely seizures can cause serious injury or even death (Sudden Death in Epilepsy \u2013 SUDEP). \u00b7     Given this it is important to treat the seizures with medication to reduce the risk of seizures happening.

D.O.B. 3.6.1995 Dear Doctor, Diagnosis: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy Seizure type and frequency: generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   1 to 2 every month   Myoclonic jerks   daily. Occasional   absence  s.  Current anti epileptic medication:   lamotrigine 250 mg BD Sodium valproate 700 mg BD    Investigations: MRI 2015 normal EEG 2014 generalised spike and wave with polyspikes. I reviewed this 23-year-old man by telephone for the first time. Previously his epilepsy has been looked after at balmoral Hospital. His epilepsy started at the age of 12. He remembers spilling things at breakfast time due to jerks in his arms. With hindsight these were myoclonic seizures. He had his first generalised tonic chronic seizure at the age of 14. He frequently gets   myoclonic jerks   before the generalised tonic chronic seizures. Although the generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   were infrequent at first they are now happening frequently. He is having one to 2 generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   every month. Unfortunately Efan suffers with his mental-health. He gets a lot of anxiety which makes it difficult to sleep at the moment. In the past he has found clobazam useful when he gets clusters of seizures. Interestingly a paternal aunt probably had   absence   epilepsy. He currently lives with his partner. Impression: mr Evans has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Comments: it may be that the lamotrigine is making the jerks worse and I would suggest slowly reducing it by 25 mg every month.

D.O.B. 3.6.1995 Dear Doctor, Diagnosis: juvenile myoclonic epilepsy Seizure type and frequency: generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   1 to 2 every month   Myoclonic jerks   daily. Occasional   absence  s.  Current anti epileptic medication:   lamotrigine 250 mg BD Sodium valproate 700 mg BD    Investigations: MRI 2015 normal EEG 2014 generalised spike and wave with polyspikes. I reviewed this 23-year-old man by telephone for the first time. Previously his epilepsy has been looked after at balmoral Hospital. His epilepsy started at the age of 12. He remembers spilling things at breakfast time due to jerks in his arms. With hindsight these were myoclonic seizures. He had his first generalised tonic chronic seizure at the age of 14. He frequently gets   myoclonic jerks   before the generalised tonic chronic seizures. Although the generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   were infrequent at first they are now happening frequently. He is having one to 2 generalised tonic clonic seizur  es   every month. Unfortunately Efan suffers with his mental-health. He gets a lot of anxiety which makes it difficult to sleep at the moment. In the past he has found clobazam useful when he gets clusters of seizures. Interestingly a paternal aunt probably had   absence   epilepsy. He currently lives with his partner. Impression: mr Evans has juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Comments: it may be that the lamotrigine is making the jerks worse and I would suggest slowly reducing it by 25 mg every month. I would be very grateful if you would assess Mr Evans\u2019s anxiety and consider treating it. There is no contraindication to using antidepressants in epilepsy and indeed it may improve his seizures.

I was pleased to hear that he is feeling much better in himself since stopping the levetiracetam and switching to the lamotrigine. His mood is far better and he feels more alert. Unfortunately he still gets his focal seizures with altered awareness where he gets twitching of his right arm. These happen around once per week. He has not had one of his bigger   focal to bilateral convulsive seizure   for three years now. We discussed various treatment options. In the first instance I recommend increasing the lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight until he is on a dose of 175mg bd. The dose can be increased further after this if necessary in a similar way. As you know he has now had 2 MRI scans. They have both shown a small hyperintensity in the posterior frontal lobe on the left.

Symptomatic structural focal epilepsy (perinatal insult)  I reviewed this 40-year-old woman in clinic today. Her main issues is headache. She has around 4 headache a month. They are associated with nausea, phonophobia and photophobia. She has to lie down in a dark room when they happen. She takes co-codamol for them.  She has had around 6 epileptic   seizure  s in her life. They started when she was 10 years old. They have all happened in her sleep. Her last   seizure   was 10 years ago.   She currently takes 150mg lamotrigine twice a day without any side effects  .  She is not taking any other medication. She works in a post office, drives, smokes around 10 cigars a day and drinks three brandy and cokes on the weekend. She lives with her partner and two children. She was born 6 weeks prematurely and weighed 3.5 pounds when she was born. It was a difficult birth. Her right hand and foot have been slightly smaller than her right since birth. She has not had any significant head injuries but did get a viral meningitis when she was 16 years old.  Her neurological examination was normal apart from some mild right hemi smallness.  An MRI in 2016 did show some changes consistent with perinatal hypoxia in the left hemisphere. An EEG in the past has shown some focal sharp waves over the left frontal lobe  Comments Her epilepsy is likely caused by hypoxic birth injury but is very stable at the moment given that she has been   seizure   free for 10 years. I would not make any changes to her lamotrigine. In terms of her migraine. I would suggest that she tries acute treatment with high dose aspirin together with a triptan as per NICE guidelines.

Symptomatic structural epilepsy secondary to previous cerebral abcess  Medication:  Levetiracetam 1000mg bd I reviewed this 56-year-old man in clinic today. He has been previously reviewed by other members of the epilepsy department. As you know his epilepsy started 16 years ago, 2 months after having brain surgery. This was to drain a right frontal lobe brain abcess. He used to have   focal motor seizures   without changes in awareness, these would involve his left arm twitching with retained awareness. He used to gets these every month but has not had a seizure like this for around two years now. He has previously had   focal to bilateral convulsive seizures  . his last one was on Christmas day 2009.  He continues to get dissociative seizures which are brought on by stress. They are different to his epilepsy seizures, are longer and he will have his eyes closed during them. Currently he his having dissociative seizures around twice every week.  He was born normally has not had any febrile seizures or significant cerebral infections apart from the brain abscess. He has not been able to work since his brain operation, previously he worked as a fork lift truck driver. He does not smoke but drinks around 20 units of alcohol per week (10 pints of mild). He has taken amphetamines in the past but has not done so since his operation. There is no relevant family history. He is not driving at the moment. He lives with his wife and 19 year old daughter.  There was a mild left hemiparesis but otherwise his neurological examination was normal.  A MRI two years ago showed an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe secondary to his previous surgery.  Comments Mr Harris does have epilepsy as a result of his brain surgery and has a tendency for ongoing epileptic seizures. He therefore needs to stay on anti-epileptic medication. However his main issue at the moment are dissociative seizures. We went over these and I explained that they are not caused by electrical disturbance that cause epileptic seizures but instead can be thought of as the brain \u201cdissociating\u201d. The website www.nonepilepticattacks.info is an excellent source of information and I will also re-refer him to neuro-psychology who have been useful in the past. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "274", "end_index": "297", "text": "Levetiracetam 1000mg bd", "attributes": {"DrugName": "levetiracetam", "DrugDose": "1000", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Our Ref AJH/LK/M6704543 NHS No 4961112233 Date 13/2/2018  The Epilepsy service  Dear Dr  r.e.

Current anti-epileptic medication:   lamtorigine 250mg bd   (to reduce as detailed below)  Previous medication tried include topiramate.  Investigations: MRI, right parietal focal cortical dysplasia  I reviewed the 36 year old salesman today in clinic. I had not met him before. He was born in Scotland and has only lived in Wales for the last two years. His previous epilepsy investigations and care has been in Scotland. His epilepsy started when he was 10 years old. He had a febrile seizure at the age of 3. He has got episodic migraine for which he take sumitryptan. There is no family history of epilepsy. He has been back driving for the last year  His seizures are quite stereotyped in that he gets a strange sensation in his left arm which rises towards his face. On the two occasions he has had bigger seizures they have started in the same way before he has lost consciousness.  He has forgotten to take his medication a few times recently and felt a lot clearer and more alert and so he asked about stopping his medication. We had a long discussion about the risks of further seizures and given the clear changes on his MRI scan he would be a relatively high risk of further seizures in the future which would affect his ability to drive. So we decided to try a slightly reduced dose of the lamotrigine. I would suggest reducing by 25 mg every fortnight until he is on a dose of 200mg twice a day. I explained that the DVLA do recommend refraining from driving whilst changes are being made to medication.

Investigations:MRI 2008, non-specific white matter changes only Previous EEG results not available  I met this 30-year-old woman together with her sister in clinic today. She has previously met my collegue Dr Love.  As you know she had her first seizure at the age of 22. She rembers when this happened, she had no warning and the first thing she remembers is waking up in the back of the ambulance. Her sister said that she went blank, stared for a while and then lost consciousness. She let out a scream and fell to the floor stiff and convulsing. She bit her tongue.  She went two years without another event which happened after she had gone to her sisters wedding. She felt hungover and nauseated the next day and had a similar event which was a convulsive epileptic seizures    . There is no obvious trigger to her seizures    , she does not have photosensitivity and has never had absences or myoclonus.  She has had infrequent seizures every since, around 1 or two per year.  She does have some depression and takes the mirtazapine to good effect for this. She is otherwise well and works in her father\u2019s butchers shop. She has two children aged 3 and 5 who are well, although the youngest Ieuan had one febrile seizures    . She herself had 2 febrile seizures at the age of 3 and 4. She did have a head injury when she was knoced off her bike at the age of 8 and was unconscious for about 10 minuts. Her paternal uncle has epilepsy for which he takes epilim.  Her neurological examination was normal apart from a longstanding slight left ptosis which has not changed. Her previous investigations are as above.  We went over the DVLA driving regulations for epilepsy. I would suggest increasing the lamotirigne by 25mg every fornight until she is taking 125mg twice a day. If Ms Cariad needs anti-depressant treatment then that would be no contraindication with her epilepsy.  I will review her EEG records for completeness and let you know the results. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "305", "end_index": "365", "text": "Lamotrigine 75mg twice a day (to increase as detailed below)", "attributes": {"Frequency": "2", "DoseUnit": "mg", "DrugName": "lamotrigine", "DrugDose": "75"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Epilepsy specialist nurse clinic Our Ref:867589 NHS No:496 576 8890 Date: 18/08/2007 Clinic Date 8/08/2007   Dear Dr  r.e.

She was referred from General Practice, after being identified as taking sodium valproate as part of the Prevent programme. She is a 27-year-old female who was diagnosed with Epilepsy at the age of 18 whilst living in London. She had two unprovoked generalised seizures, and was trialled on multiple anti-epileptic drugs including Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, and Carbamazepine which were either ineffective or caused side-effects. Once commenced on sodium valproate 400mg twice daily,   she has had no further seizures  . She does not experience any significant side-effects and takes the medication reliably. Her MRI brain and EEG were normal at the time of diagnosis. There is no other significant past medical history, and she does not take any other regular medications. There is no relevant family history. We discussed the Prevent programme and the need to take reliable effective contraception whilst taking Sodium Valproate, due to the risk of side-effects to the developing baby should she become pregnant. Miss Lewis has a partner and is sexually active but has the IM Depo Provera via her GP. She understands the importance of maintaining this and to inform us if there are any changes or if she plans to become pregnant. With her permission I have completed the Prevent programme form to reflect these circumstances and we will review her on an annual basis. Plan 1.   Continue Sodium Valproate 400mg twice daily   2.

I am pleased to say that he has been   seizure free   since starting antiepileptic medication.    Unfortunately however, he has had problems with mood swings and irritability.  He switched Levetiracetam to Brivaracetam, with a little improvement. He has a good insight into potential causes of this, including the impact the diagnosis has had on his mental health and lifestyle, particularly inability to drive, and the general impact of COVID and lockdown.    Plan:  We discussed the options of continuing Brivaracetam, or switching to an alternative medication, such as Lamotrigine.  While it is possible that this would be better in terms of irritability, there is no guarantee that it would control his seizures as well and for now he would prefer to continue unchanged.

We went through his diagnosis of epilepsy and the fact that there is an old change in his brain in the left temporal lobe which is the probable cause of his epilepsy.

She has been diagnosed with non epileptic psychogenic seizures which is confirmed on EEG.In the past she has had a normal MRI . She also has significant anxiety.   She has been   seizure free   for more than five years. She only drinks a small amount of alcohol and doesn't take any recreational drugs.   She does continue to take   sodium valproate   200 milligrammes twice a day. She feels that when the   sodium valproate   was reduced she started having episodes of shakiness without losing consciousness and it had to be restarted.

She was accompanied to the clinic by her sister. For the last six month she has been having possible seizures. She says she gets a feeling of detachment which is followed by blacking out. Her sister reported that there is some jerking of her arms and legs and some frothing of the mouth. When she comes around, she feels tired and confused. She says it takes up to 2 hours to fully get back to normal. Current frequency of the   seizures   is once or twice a month, but last month there was a   cluster   of 3 in a single day and she was taken to A&E. There is also a history of staring episodes which last up to 2 minutes. They occur 3 to 5 times a week.   Ms Underwood lives with her partner who is often away. Her sister has been staying with them since February. There is no family history of note. She is not aware of having suffered febrile   seizures   in her childhood or any serious infections. There is no history of head injuries. Ms Underwood is currently not working but she volunteers in a charity shop. She stopped driving. There was some history of alcohol abuse, but she said she now only drinks occasionally, and not at all since starting treatment. She is a non-smoker.  Her examination today was normal, with no neurological deficit.  She is still awaiting her EEG examination. I am also requesting an MRI brain .  My impression is that we are dealing with generalised tonic clonic   seizures   probably with a focal onset. Her other episode could possibly be complex partial seizures.   She was commenced on   Sodium Valproate   following her seizure   cluster   and is now on 400mg bd. She has not experienced any side effects. She has not yet reached the maintenance dose but given her history and her weight concerns this may not be the best choice of treatment.

He has a good insight into potential causes of this, including the impact the diagnosis has had on his mental health and lifestyle, particularly inability to drive, and the general impact of COVID and lockdown.    Plan:  We discussed the options of continuing Brivaracetam, or switching to an alternative medication, such as Lamotrigine.

He had his first seizure in June 2016 and the second one in December 2016. Both were witnessed by his girlfriend. There was no warning and no trigger.  She described how he let out a scream and lost consciousness. There was stiffening of his whole body followed by generalised jerking. There was stertorous breathing, a lateral tongue bite on one occasion but no cyanosis. It lasted for around 5 minutes and he was confused after.   He is otherwise well and not on any other medication.  There is no history of intracranial infections, head injuries or febrile convulsions.  There is no clear history of myoclonic jerks.  He lives with his partner and works as hairdresser. He does not drink excessively and denies recreational drugs.   I note that an MRI brain and 12 lead ECG were normal.   Impression: The history here is consistent with 2 unprovoked generalised tonic clonic seizures, without any clear focal onset, and he needs to be on treatment.  We discussed the following: 1.In terms of further investigations I will arrange an EEG 3.I would suggest that he starts Levetiracetam as shown above. The main side effects are tiredness, light- headedness and mood change.  4.We discussed driving and that he should inform the DVLA and refrain from driving until he has been seizure free for 12 months 5.We discussed some of the saetyapects around the diagnosis around epilepsy, including SUDEP  I will request a follow up appointment with the epilepsy nurse in a couple of months time to make sure he is getting on well. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "160", "end_index": "231", "text": "Levetiracetam 250mgs od increasing by 250mgs every 2 weeks to 500mgs bd", "attributes": {"DrugName": "levetiracetam", "DrugDose": "250", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "1"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 02/06/2017  Dear Dr,  Re: Miss Lemwn Thomas D.O.B: 07/12/1998 24 Heol Betws, Morriston, Swansea, SA12 6KG    Diagnosis: \u2022New diagnosis of epilepsy with generalised tonic clonic seizures from sleep \u2022Type 1 diabetes  Medication: \u2022Insulin \u2022  Levetiracetam 250mgs once a day  , increasing by 250mgs every 2 weeks to 500mgs bd  I reviewed this 18-year-old lady in the Virtual First Seizure Clinic along with her boyfriend. She has had a few episodes from sleep.  The first occurred in May 2017. Her boyfriend was woken by her shaking and groaning. Lemwn came round in hospital feeling disorientated.  Her BM was within normal range.    The most recent episode occurred last week and was similar in nature. Head and eyes were tunred to the side, there was jerking, hyper-salivation and noisy breathing.  On this occasion, she bit her tongue and felt disorientated on coming round.  Her BM was checked immediately afterwards, which was 3.4. There are no obvious triggers for this.  There is no previous history of seizures, head injuries or intracranial infections.    She has a background of type 1 diabetes and has occasional hypos, so is aware of the symptoms.  She has no other medical problems and is not on any other medication.    She lives with her parents and is currently studying English in University. She is learning to drive, is a non-smoker and drinks occasional alcohol.    Impression:  Lemwn has had episodes suggestive of unprovoked generalised tonic clonic seizures, occurring from sleep. It is possible that there is a focal, frontal lobe onset but she needs further investigations  There is no evidence to suggest that these were secondary to hypoglycaemia.  We discussed the following:  1.In terms of further investigations, I will arrange an MRI brain and an EEG. 2.I think she needs to go on antiepileptic medication and I will start Levetiracetam as shown above.  The main side effects are tiredness, light-headedness and occasionally a change in mood 3.We discussed the driving regulations.  She will need to inform the DVLA and refrain from driving, until she has been seizure free for 12 months (although there are some caveats in patients, who only have seizures from sleep) 4.We discussed some of the issues around safety, such as having showers rather than baths.

She is now 47 years old. She has had epilepsy for several years. She does not get   seizures   very often and her last seizure was two years ago. She previously has been 10 years without seizures. There are no obvious triggers to her   seizures   but they are frequently associated with stressful situation. She has never had absences or myoclonus or clinical photo sensitivity.   Her   seizures   seem bilateral tonic-clonic in nature. An MRI was performed on 23 September 2016, there were no abnormalities.   Mrs liver understand the risks of continuing with sodium valproate and the potential harms to the new born baby should she become pregnant. However she has no plans for more children and her periods are becoming irregular. She would like to stay on the sodium valproate given that it is has kept her seizure free for a relatively long period. Given her type of generalised epilepsy, it is probably the best medication for her and she was happy to sign the risk acknowledgement form today.

I think everolimus would be the best option here however if this isn't an option then we could consider adding in zonismaide at 25 milligrammes everyday increasing by 25 milligrammes every week to 100 milligrammes twice a day .

She had   generalised tonic clonic seizures   and myoclonic jerks at this age. Initially she was treated with lamotrigine which had no effect. She was changed over to sodium valproate. She's had a sustained period of seizure freedom in terms of   generalised tonic clonic seizures   having been seven years without any tonic clonic although she continues to get m  yoclonic jerks.   There's no history of absences.  She reports no significant side effects from the sodium valproate in terms of weight gain or loss of hair. She has an implant contraceptive and is currently not having periods.  She probably had perinatal hypoxia and a diagnosis of learning disabilities was made at the age of 7. Her family are her main carers are present. She has not had any febrile seizures, meningitis or significant head injury. There is no history of epilepsy in the family.  Neurological examination does not reveal any abnormalities.  The history is suggestive of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy . I am arranging an MRI of the brain given that epilepsy is not completely controlled.   She is peri menopausal and would not like to make any changes to her medication as her epilepsy is well controlled. I did however explain to her and her father the side effects of sodium valproate which include teratogenicity. I have given her a book and her father signed the Valproate risk acknowledgment form.

DOB 18/02/1954  I reviewed this 52-year-old woman in clinic today, together with her husband. She was referred for ongoing management of her epilepsy and so I will recap her epilepsy history.  Mrs Lorenzo was born normally. She had one febrile   seizure   at the age of 3 years. She had a mild viral meningitis at the age of 18 years but has not had any encephalitis or significant head injuries.  She had three A-levels and studied law at university before going on to work as a paralegal. At the age of 32 she had a significant collapse and was found to have a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured ACA aneurysm. This was treated with endovascular coiling. She possibly had one   seizure   at the time of the subarachnoid haemorrhage but was not started on medication as it was thought that this was an acute symptomatic seizures.  Three years later, at the age of 35 she had two episodes of transient loss of consciousness which were thought to be tonic-clonic seizures and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 36. Initially she was treated with phenytoin but this was switched to   levetiracetam   2 years ago. Currently she is taking 750mg twice a day of the   levetiracetam   and her last   seizure   was 2 years ago. She has returned to work and is driving. She lives with her husband and two sons. He youngest son had 2 febrile seizures and had childhood absence epilepsy although he is now   seizure   free. She doesn\u2019t smoke but drinks around 12 units of alcohol (6 cans of lager) a week.  Apart from the epilepsy she takes ramipril for hypertension and simvastatin for hypercolestrolaemia.  Mrs Lorenzo does find that she is very irritable and short tempered since starting the levetiracetam. This seems to be having an effect on her quality of life and she would be very keen to change this.  Her neurological examination today was essentially normal. Blood pressure was 126/67, her pulse was 68 and regular.  A recent CT scan on 3/7/2016 is degraded but the artefact from the coil but does show an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe. An EEG from 1990 shows slow waves with ocassional right sided sharp waves.  I agree with the diagnosis of symptomatic structural epilepsy, secondary to the previous sub-arachnoid haemorrhage. Given the significant modd changes which are likely due to side effects of the   levetiracetam   I would suggest changing to brivetiracetam. This can be done with a straight switch to 75mg bd of the brivetiracetam. I went through the DVLA guideance on driving when switching medication.  I will review her in clinic in 6 months time and will ask for an epilepsy nurse review.

As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 4. The reason for her epilepsy is that she had some hypoxia during a difficult birth.  She continues to have around 2 secondary generalised   seizur  es per year. Her   seizur  e was about 2 months ago. They always start with some right sided arm movement and then Mrs Johns has around 10 seconds before she looses consciousness. She has taken   sodium valproate   for a long time and is currently taking 1g twice a day. The last time I saw her I advised starting   lamotrigine  . She is now taking 50mg twice a day. She thinks that this may have helped her   seizur  es and interestingly her mood has improved since taking the   lamotrigine  . She also takes sertraline for her anxiety and depression.

As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 4. The reason for her epilepsy is that she had some hypoxia during a difficult birth.  She continues to have around 2 secondary generalised   seizur  es per year. Her   seizur  e was about 2 months ago. They always start with some right sided arm movement and then Mrs Johns has around 10 seconds before she looses consciousness. She has taken   sodium valproate   for a long time and is currently taking 1g twice a day. The last time I saw her I advised starting   lamotrigine  . She is now taking 50mg twice a day. She thinks that this may have helped her   seizur  es and interestingly her mood has improved since taking the   lamotrigine  . She also takes sertraline for her anxiety and depression.

As you know he had his first seizure in 2012 and was diagnosed with epilepsy on the same year. Brain imaging at the time picked up the meningioma which was operated on later in the year. He has continued to have sterotyped focal seizures which consist of left arm jerking. He gets an associated difficult to describe feeling in his arm. Around half of the time his awareness will be impaired during these episodes. He has not had any \u201cbig\u201d   (secondary generalised seizures  ) seizures since a few months after his operation.  Mr Jenkins also has depression and anxiety. You have recently started citalopram although he is not finding this very helpful. He lives with his wife and has not driven since the operation.

His recent MRI showed changes consistent with previous surgery in the right frontal lobe but no new changes.  Comments.

She has previously seen other epilepsy consultants and the epilepsy nurse. As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2012 following a severe traumatic brain injury where she fell down 12 flights of stairs, had traumatic contusions and a tramatuic sub dural haemorrhage. Last year she had around 15   generalised tonic clonic seizure  s. She is also having small attacks where she stares, has speech arrest and may smack her lips. I think that these are complex partial seizures. She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day. She gets chronic daily headache and takes at least 8 co-codamol tablets a day to try and help with this.  As you know Alice used to work as a teaching assistant and is very keen to return to work in the long term. She wants to get better seizure control to achieve this. It seems like Alice\u2019s epilepsy control is suboptimal. She still has some mood problems and so I would not increase the levetiracetam more.

For the last 10 months he has been having d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu episodes which are associated with nausea and an odd taste in his mouth. The episodes are short, lasting less than a minute, and he is fully aware throughout. Present frequency is 4 to 5 episodes a month.   His birth was normal. There is no history of febrile seizures, brain infections, or head injury. There is no family history of epilepsy. He is generally fit and well.  His neurological examination today was totally normal.  His EEG which was done last November is reported as mildly abnormal,  containing bi-temporal irregular slow activity. There was no frank epileptiform activity seen. He is still awaiting an MRI examination. Comments: The episodes are suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy.  He should be started on Carbamazepine 200md bd. I will review him in my clinic following his MRI examination.

The cause of his epilepsy was a significant traumatic brain injury in 2006. As you know he had an accident whilst working on the farm and a piece of tractor equipment fell on his head, knocking him unconscious. He was admitted to the neurosurgical centre as he had a skull fracture and a traumatic sub arachnoid haemorrhage which was managed conservatively.   He started having seizures in 2008 and was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2009. He gets   complex partial seizures   (deja-vu and orofacial automatsisms) as well as   secondary generalised seizures  . The   complex partial seizures   are now happening once a month, and he has around 1-2   secondary generalised seizures   per year. He is taking   levetiracetam   1500mg bd as well as   lamotrigine   200mg bd and   clobazam   for seizure clusters (he takes this infrequently).  Since the accident Mr Williams has been getting flashbacks and feels low in mood. I would be very grateful if you could asses him for this. I would also suggest changing the   levetiracetam   to brivetiracetam 100mg bd. If he is still having seizures after this then I would suggest increasing the   lamotrigine   to 250mg bd in steps of 50mg every 2 weeks.  TO recap his investigations, he had a MRI of his brain a few years ago which was abnormal and shows some right fronto-temporal changes consistent with his previous brain injury. There are some focal epileptiform changes on his EEG from 2010, also in the right fronto/temporal areas. Mr Williams lives with his wife and has stopped driving since the accident. He is happy to contact us via the epilepsy nurses should there be any issues.

Joan does have some stress in her life at the moment which might have been a provoking factor for her seizures.

Her seizures began last year. Joan does not really remember what happens during a seizure. She has been told that she sees sees things that aren\u2019t there and her speech is not normal.  David says that she seems to panic, she may move her arms around start talking abnormally. After an event she will be confused and need to sleep. We discussed her diagnosis today in some detail. Her MRI has been reported as normal and she is awaiting an appointment for an EEG.  There are lots of resources available to help explain epilepsy in the family .We briefly discussed SUEDEP. We discussed that sharing a bed reduces the risk of SUDEP.  Joan says the   seizure   frequency is roughly every 4 weeks at present. We explained that this will become less over time as the medication is increased. She tells us that the Lamotrigine has helped her recover after seizures. She has a good support network, however her family are some distance away. Daniel is currently working from home and he is there to support her and the children. We also discussed contraception and I explained that the depo injection and lamotrigine can interact.  Another thing we discussed today is Joan\u2019s mood. She has had a low mood for several years and has previously been prescribed sertraline. We discussed today how depression is common in epilepsy. We have advised today that it would be beneficial to consider an anti-depressant she feels in the past the sertraline was not of much use. Please could you arrange to her in regards to her mental health.  We have also explained to Joan that we run an open access service and we will not send her a routine follow up appointment with the epilepsy nurses. She knows that if she does need an appointment or need any support what so ever with her epilepsy she is free to call us whenever she wants.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "58", "end_index": "148", "text": "Medication: Currently Lamotrigine 75mg bd to increase over the following weeks to 125mg bd", "attributes": {"DrugDose": "75", "DrugName": "lamotrigine", "DoseUnit": "mg", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 10/4/2017  Re:Mr Tom ShippingtonDOB 10/09/1976  Diagnosis: Epilepsy Abnormal left frontal lobe signal Migraine Asthma  I undertook a consultation with Tom, I also spoke with Tom\u2019s partner with his permission.

You had seen him as a ward referral when he was admitted to hospital.  He\u2019s had episodes of transient loss of consciousness since the age of 17. During these episodes he has injured himself, including having bitten his tongue. Before these episodes he will get a strange feeling in his stomach where it will \u201cturn in on itself\u201d. He can also get these sensations by themselves. He has taken recreational drugs in the past such as amphetamine but these episdoes have occurred unprovoked. I think that these represent focal epileptic seizures  There is no significant family history apart from his grandfather having a few seizures in the context of a febrile illness. He has been knocked unconscious twice in the past when he has been involved in fights.  Since you have started him on the lamotrigine he has not had any further episdoes. He does have some reflux for which he takes lansoprazole and he also takes citalopram for low mood.  You thought that his neurological examination was normal and I note the normal investigations.  I explained the diagnosis of epilepsy to Mr Terazzo, it is relatively common and causes seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Rarely seizures can be dangerous and can cause serious injury or even death. If Mr Terazzo were to have further seizures then I would in the first instance increase the lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight.

Edwina had concerns about taking anti-depressant medication and the risk of increased seizures. However I explained that anti-depressants are not contraindicatied in epilepsy and there is some evidence that they might reduced seizures frequency. As you know she has had a normal MRI scan last year and previously has had an abnormal EEG with some generalised (spike and wave) abnormalities.

I was pleased to hear that he remains   seizure free   and is driving again. When he tried to stop it a few years ago his seizures came back.  We had a discussion about changing the medication or withdrawing the medication completely. Simon knows about the seizure reoccurrence risk of reducing his medication and the fact that he would need to stop driving for six months whilst this is taking place. He wonders whether the tiredness is something to do with his carbamazepine although I note that this is long standing.  I would recommend not making any changes. If however, Simon was keen to change the medication int he future then I would suggest introducing lamotrigine at 25mg once a day, increasing by 25mg every fortnight, aiming 75mg bd. At this dose I would start to reduce the carbamazepine by 200mg every two weeks until it stops.

I do not have the results of his recent EEG test.  His neurological examination was normal today and he does not have any other medical problems.  Comments: I dont have a definite conclusion as to the cause of his episodes of loss of consciousness. I thought today that the episodes sounded more like syncope however he does have learning disabilities and has previously had seizures and so epilepsy needs to be borne in mind.

He was well from an epilepsy point of view until he had a   seizur  e last month. His wife heard a bang from the next room and went in to see him unconsciouss on the floor. He was stiff, his eyes were open and he made unusual groaning noises before starting to shake. This lasted about 40 seconds before he went to a \u201cdeep sleep\u201d. It took him several hours to recover fully. Mr Owens himself remembers his right leg twitching before he lost consciousness. I think therefore that this was a   focal to bilateral convulsive   seizur    es. As you recall Mr Owens has had focal motor   seizur  es in the past where he has had jerking of his right leg. These were happening frequently before he started the medication. The last event was probably 10 months ago. He has had one previous   focal to bilateral convulsive   seizur    e at the time of diagnosis of his epilepsy in May 2017. As you will recall his MRI at the time was abnormal with an area of ischaemic damage in the left inferior frontal lobe. This is the probable cause of his epilepsy. An EEG in 2017 did show some left sided sharp waves.    He is currently taking lamotrigine 75mg twice a day   and given the recent   seizur  e I would be very grateful if you could increase this by 25mg every fortnight to 100mg twice a day. It can be increased further if necessary in a similar way. Previously he tried levetiracetam but this made his mood worse.  Mr Owens has ongoing problems with his mood and finds it very difficult to leave the house. He has found anti-depressants useful in the past and I would be very grateful if you could reassess him from his mental health point of view. There is no contraindication to treatment with anti-depressants if necessary. Mr Owens is still managing to work as an accountant and he is aware of the DVLA driving regulations. He is currently drinking around 40units of alcohol a week.

I am pleased to note that he has returned to his job with the insurance company and has also started driving lessons.

He has a background history of hypertension and diabetes (controlled by insulin) for the last ten years. He was diagnosed with epilepsy ten years ago and his seizures were well controlled on   lamotrigine  . At the time of his diagnosis he had a MRI and EEG which were both normal. He stopped the   lamotrigine   of his own accord last year and this caused a reoccurance of his seizures. There were happening around twice per month before he reintroduced his   lamotrigine  . He tells me that the seizures consist of staring episodes where he loses awareness of his surrounding for a few mintues. He does know that there are about to happen as he gets an unusual sensation which is difficult to describe.  He also gets episodes of hypoglycaemia several times per week and he is not always aware of these. He does not check his blood sugar regularly although he does have a portable BM monitor.

Levetiracetam to start  Insulin Atorvastatin Ramipril  I reviewed John in clinic today. His baseline has been around one or two seizures per year. Things have got a bit worse recently and he is having one or two seizures per month. He now does not get a warning that the seizures are going to happen although he previously did get an unusual deja-vu sensation.  He has tried higher doses of lamotrigine in the past but this has caused more tiredness. We had a chat today about adding in another medication and I would be grateful if you could start Levetiracetam. Generally it is well tolerated but can cause tiredness and mood change in higher doses. Please can you prescribe 250mg once a day increasing by 250mg every fortnight to an initial target dose of 500mg twice a day.  As you know he had a MRI scan in 2014 which was normal apart from a few scattered tiny hyperintensities. An EEG last year showed some non-specific slowing in both frontal regions. As before I have asked John to keep a careful eye on his blood sugars to make sure that he is not having hypoglycaemic events. I will request an up to date EEG and review him with the results. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "62", "end_index": "74", "text": "Lamotrigine ", "attributes": {"DoseUnit": "mg", "DrugName": "Lamotrigine", "DrugDose": "100", "Frequency": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Diagnosis:Probable non-epileptic psychogenic seizure  s   Complex partial seizure  s   with secondary generalised seizure  s    Medication:  Sodium valproate   1000mg twice a day  I reviewed Sheila for this first time today in clinic.

She will frequently feel sick as well before going on to having generalised body shakes but her eye will stay closed. She in unable to respond but can hear people taking when these are happening.  Her neurological examination was normal.  She also has anxiety for which she takes sertraline.   There is a possibility that some of these episodes are non-epileptic in nature and so I have requested an up to date EEG. Videos of the events will also help.

She remembers coming home from the office (she works for an insurance company) in the afternoon. She remembers telling her mother that she didn\u2019t feel right before loosing consciousness and then waking up in hospital. She had bitten her tongue and had muscles aches in her arms and legs the next day.  Her mother was able to describe the event in more detail. She sad that she went stiff, gave out a shout before falling to the floor and convulsing for about a minute. She had a previous similar event around 8 months ago.  There is no history of events resembling focal seizures, absences or myoclonus. She was born prematurely at 32 weeks weighing 5lbs. She did not have febrile seizures, significant cerebral infections or significant head injuries. She has already started taking   lamotrigine   (current dose is 50mg twice a day) and does not take any other medication apart from the oral contraceptive pill.  Charlotte did have a driving licence before these event but has surrounded it to the DVLA after informing them of the diagnosis. She drinks alcohol with her friends on the weekend but does not smoke. Her neurological examination and ECG was normal in clinic today.  An MRI brain performed last month was normal. An EEG from May shows paroxysms of generalised spike and wave activity but no photosensitivity.  Impression. I think that the two events of loss of consciousness were generalised tonic-clonic seizures. This, together with the abnormal EEG mean that there is a diagnosis of epilepsy, namely genetic generalised epilepsy.  Comments. I explained the diagnosis to Charlotte and the need for long term treatment with epilepsy medication given the risk of injury and rare risk of death with epilepsy. The   lamotrigine   dose can be increased further should there be any further seizures. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "974", "end_index": "985", "text": "lamotrigine", "attributes": {"DrugDose": "50", "DrugName": "Lamotrigine", "Frequency": "2", "DoseUnit": "mg"}}}
