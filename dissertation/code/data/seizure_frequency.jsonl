Investigations: CT head 2017 collier in situ plus low density right temporal lobe  I reviewed this 57 year old man in clinic today. He continues to have what he calls \u201cabsences\u201d which are focal seizures. During them, he has a smell which is difficult to describe. He will lose awareness for a couple of minutes. When he has the warning of an unusual smell he will sit down. He injured his right elbow in a seizure last year.  As he is continuing to have seizures, I suggest that he increases the lamotrigine slowly by 25 mg every fortnight, to an initial dose of 100 mg twice a day. If he has no side-effects with this, then he can again continue to increases the lamotrigine by no more than 25 mg every fortnight.  I will see him again in around six months time, should there be a problem before then he can contact my secretary on the number above.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "239", "end_index": "276", "text": "focal seizures with loss of awareness", "attributes": {"LowerNumberOfSeizures": "2", "UpperNumberOfSeizures": "3", "TimePeriod": "Month", "NumberOfTimePeriods": "1"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Dear Dr,  Diagnosis: focal epilepsy-Probable temporal Current antiepileptic medication:   carbamazepine   400 mg twice a day   Topiramate 100 mg BD    I revealed this 42 year old lady together with her husband in clinic today.

He had 4 febrile   seizures   at the age of 3, 4 and then around five. He had some viral meningitis when he was in his late teenage years while he was doing a levels.  He had an MRI brain performed in 2016. This does show some left-sided cortical and deep white matter changes which are probably representative of a perinatal insult.  Comments: In terms of his migraine and I would try acute treatment with high-dose ibuprofen or dispersible aspirin together with a Triptan. If this is not successful then I would consider preventative treatment such as propranolol or possibly tompiramate given his epilepsy.

His wife also joined in the consultation. As you know he had a significant brain injury in 2005 when he was involved in a head on car crash at 40mph. He was unconscious and in hospital for a week at the time. He has been left with left sided weakness since the accident. He also has ongoing problems with his mood and has seen the community mental health team for this.   On 23rd September 2019 he remembers having unusual episodes of a strange \u201cout of body\u201d experience. He has several of these in the morning and then had another one in the afternoon before loosing consciousness. The next thing he remembers is waking up in hospital. He has not had any further events. His wife witnessed the events and said that his eyes were fixed looking in the left before he left out a scream and then lost consciousness. He went stiff and started shaking and his lips went blue. This lasted a few minutes before he started to recover but then he had another 3 evetns in quick sucession and was taken to hospital. Whilst in hospital he had a MRI scan which confirmed some structural brain changes due to his accident.   He hasn\u2019t been able to work since the accident but was an electrician before hand. He is a non-smoker but drinks around 25 units of alcohol per week and smokes ocassional cannabis. He was driving before this event. He had 2 febrile seizures at the ages of 14 and 18 months. He also had viral encephalitis when he was 18 years old. His paternal grandfather had epilepsy after a brain tumor.   His MRI in hospital showed some gliosis secondary to his brain injury and an EEG at the time showed some R sided sharp waves.   Impression. Mr Richards has focal epilepsy secondary to his traumatic brain injury.   \u00b7     I explained the diagnosis of epilepsy to Mr Richards \u00b7     Epilepsy is relatively common, affecting around 30,000 people in Wales. Epilepsy causes seizures which can be thought of as electrical disturbances in the brain. Although most seizures are uneventful sometimes seizures can cause injury and very rarely seizures can cause serious injury or even death (Sudden Death in Epilepsy \u2013 SUDEP). \u00b7     Given this it is important to treat the seizures with medication to reduce the risk of seizures happening. Overall there is around a 70% of treating the seizures successfully with medication. \u00b7     I would be grateful if you could continue to prescribe the levetiracetam. I have enclosed an information leaflet on levetiracetam with this letter. If Mr Richards has further seizures then I would increase it to 1000mg bd. It could be further increased after that to 1250mg bd \u00b7     Levetiracetam is generally well tolerated but occasionally can cause mood changes \u00b7     In terms of driving, I explained the current DVLA rules on driving with epilepsy. Mr Richards needs to stop driving and inform the DVLA of the diagnosis. He is not able to drive until he has been 1 year free of seizures. \u00b7     It would be important to consider safety in some activities where seizures could be dangerous. For example Mr Richards should not have baths alone and take showers instead and climbing ladders or operating some types of machinery could be dangerous. I also explained some first aid measure of what to do when a seizure happens. \u00b7     Having said this it is important to lead as normal life as possible and most people with epilepsy can do this. \u00b7     It is important though for yourself or Mr Richards to contact us via telephone or email (the details are at the top of this letter) if there are any problems or questions about the epilepsy at any stage. with him. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "270", "end_index": "308", "text": "Focal to bilateral convulsive seizures", "attributes": {"NumberOfSeizures": "0", "MonthDate": "10", "YearDate": "2019", "TimeSince_or_TimeOfEvent": "Since"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 3.4.2002 Ann Evans.

Lisa continues to get jerks several times a day. She also gets   tonic clonic seizures  . The last one of these happened around three weeks ago. Tiredness and stress make these worse. Unfortunately she is getting quite a bit of stress at the moment deal to problems with her ex partner. She is also finding it difficult to remember things.

His seizures started at the age of 32. His partner was able to give a good description of his seizures. He feels funny and needs to sit down, he may appear to smile without emotion and his hands may twitch a bit. He is unable to respond properly during the seizures. Sometime he will repeat questions like \u201cwho are you?\u201d. These sound like complex partial seizures. Normally he will have around 2-3 seizures per month but has gone 6 months   seizures free  . His memory is getting worse and his partner says that despite writing things down in lists he still forgets to do things and ocassionally forgets his tables. He has a past medical history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension. He was born after a normal vaginal delivery at term. He developed normally and was \u201caverage\u201d at school. There is no history of febrile seizures or meningitis or head injury. He left school at 16 and works as a bartender but unfortunately lost his job after the epilepsy started. He is right handed, has never smoked and drinks around 10 pints of pale ale per week. Neurological examination today was normal. He had a MRI in 2006 which was normal and an EEG at the time showed some possible abnormalities in the right temporal lobe. We discussed the possibility of epilepsy surgery and Mr Richards felt that it would be worth pursuing. I will therefore request an up to date MRI and request video EEG telemetry. In the mean time it would be worth increasing the eslicarbazine to 1200mg od.  ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "723", "end_index": "736", "text": "seizures free", "attributes": {"NumberOfSeizures": "0", "TimePeriod": "Month", "NumberOfTimePeriods": "6"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```NHS No 226 885 8754 Date: 13/10/2018 Christian Moon.

Symptomatic structural epilepsy secondary to previous cerebral abcess  Medication:  Levetiracetam 1000mg bd I reviewed this 56-year-old man in clinic today. He has been previously reviewed by other members of the epilepsy department. As you know his epilepsy started 16 years ago, 2 months after having brain surgery. This was to drain a right frontal lobe brain abcess. He used to have   focal motor seizures   without changes in awareness, these would involve his left arm twitching with retained awareness. He used to gets these every month but has not had a seizure like this for around two years now. He has previously had   focal to bilateral convulsive seizures  . his last one was on Christmas day 2009.  He continues to get dissociative seizures which are brought on by stress. They are different to his epilepsy seizures, are longer and he will have his eyes closed during them. Currently he his having dissociative seizures around twice every week.  He was born normally has not had any febrile seizures or significant cerebral infections apart from the brain abscess. He has not been able to work since his brain operation, previously he worked as a fork lift truck driver. He does not smoke but drinks around 20 units of alcohol per week (10 pints of mild). He has taken amphetamines in the past but has not done so since his operation. There is no relevant family history. He is not driving at the moment. He lives with his wife and 19 year old daughter.  There was a mild left hemiparesis but otherwise his neurological examination was normal.  A MRI two years ago showed an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe secondary to his previous surgery.  Comments Mr Harris does have epilepsy as a result of his brain surgery and has a tendency for ongoing epileptic seizures. He therefore needs to stay on anti-epileptic medication. However his main issue at the moment are dissociative seizures. We went over these and I explained that they are not caused by electrical disturbance that cause epileptic seizures but instead can be thought of as the brain \u201cdissociating\u201d. The website www.nonepilepticattacks.info is an excellent source of information and I will also re-refer him to neuro-psychology who have been useful in the past. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "581", "end_index": "601", "text": "focal motor seizures", "attributes": {"NumberOfSeizures": "0", "TimePeriod": "Year", "NumberOfTimePeriods": "2"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```NHS No 4961112233 Date 19/9/2016   Dear Dr  r.e.

He was born normally has not had any febrile seizures or significant cerebral infections apart from the brain abscess. He has not been able to work since his brain operation, previously he worked as a fork lift truck driver. He does not smoke but drinks around 20 units of alcohol per week (10 pints of mild). He has taken amphetamines in the past but has not done so since his operation. There is no relevant family history. He is not driving at the moment. He lives with his wife and 19 year old daughter.  There was a mild left hemiparesis but otherwise his neurological examination was normal.  A MRI two years ago showed an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe secondary to his previous surgery.  Comments Mr Harris does have epilepsy as a result of his brain surgery and has a tendency for ongoing epileptic seizures. He therefore needs to stay on anti-epileptic medication. However his main issue at the moment are dissociative seizures. We went over these and I explained that they are not caused by electrical disturbance that cause epileptic seizures but instead can be thought of as the brain \u201cdissociating\u201d. The website www.nonepilepticattacks.info is an excellent source of information and I will also re-refer him to neuro-psychology who have been useful in the past. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "818", "end_index": "856", "text": "focal to bilateral convulsive seizures", "attributes": {"NumberOfSeizures": "0", "DayDate": "25", "MonthDate": "12", "YearDate": "2009", "TimeSince_or_TimeOfEvent": "Since"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Our Ref AJH/LK/M6704543 NHS No 4961112233 Date 13/2/2018  The Epilepsy service  Dear Dr  r.e.

As you know he had a cluster of convulsive seizures for the first time in February. He suddenly went unconscious during a meal, let out a scream and started shaking. His lips went blue and the care home staff phoned 999. He was admitted to hospital then and started on levetiracetam. He has got quite advanced dementia and needs help for all activites of daily living and has no verbal communication.   Tanya has noticed that Mr Rowlands gets some \u201cblank\u201d episodes recently. During these he will stare and look blank for a couple of minutes and sometimes fall asleep afterwards.  Impression. Mr Rowlands has an epilepsy which is probably caused by his underlying dementia.  Comments. I think that the \u201cblank\u201d episodes are focal seizures with altered awareness and so it would be worth increasing the levetiracetam to 500mg bd.

Ms Linda Ivy. DOB 02/01/1980  Diagnosis: Probable temporal lobe epilepsy  I reviewed this 38 year old woman by telephone consultation today. She has previously been reviewed by my colleagues. Her epilepsy started at the age of 3 years old and has continued ever since. The longest period of seizures freedom that she has had is 2 years. Currently she gets seizures about once per month which are   complex partial seizures  . She will have a funny feeling of a \u201cfuzzy\u201d head before losing awareness and wandering about in a confused manner. She has only had a few   secondarily generalised seizures   in her life the last one being about 10 years ago when she forgot her medication.    She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg bd as well as   carbamazepine   400mg bd  . In the past she has tried, sodium valproate, topiramate and lamotrigine. An MRI in 2012 showed probable left hippocampal sclerosis and EEGs in the past have showed consistent left focal temporal slowing.  She was born normally at term but did get 2 febrile seizures at the age of 18 and 28 month. When she was 7 years old she fell of her bike and lost consciousness for 30mins. She was observed in hospital overnight but didn\u2019t need any surgery. Her youngest sister has had two febrile seizures and a maternal aunt has epilepsy and takes   carbamazepine   for this.

Ms Linda Ivy. DOB 02/01/1980  Diagnosis: Probable temporal lobe epilepsy  I reviewed this 38 year old woman by telephone consultation today. She has previously been reviewed by my colleagues. Her epilepsy started at the age of 3 years old and has continued ever since. The longest period of seizures freedom that she has had is 2 years. Currently she gets seizures about once per month which are   complex partial seizures  . She will have a funny feeling of a \u201cfuzzy\u201d head before losing awareness and wandering about in a confused manner. She has only had a few   secondarily generalised seizures   in her life the last one being about 10 years ago when she forgot her medication.    She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg bd as well as   carbamazepine   400mg bd  . In the past she has tried, sodium valproate, topiramate and lamotrigine. An MRI in 2012 showed probable left hippocampal sclerosis and EEGs in the past have showed consistent left focal temporal slowing.  She was born normally at term but did get 2 febrile seizures at the age of 18 and 28 month. When she was 7 years old she fell of her bike and lost consciousness for 30mins. She was observed in hospital overnight but didn\u2019t need any surgery. Her youngest sister has had two febrile seizures and a maternal aunt has epilepsy and takes   carbamazepine   for this.  She works as a teaching assistant and does not drive. She smokes around 10 cigaretts a day and drinks a bottle of wine at the weekend. She lives with her husband and two children who are aged 6 and 4.  Impression. She does have temporal lobe epilepsy which is probably caused by the hippocampal sclerosis.

We went over the DVLA driving regulations for epilepsy. I would suggest increasing the lamotirigne by 25mg every fornight until she is taking 125mg twice a day. If Ms Cariad needs anti-depressant treatment then that would be no contraindication with her epilepsy.

Her last   seizure   before this was in 2006. She is 2 weeks post-partum after giving birth to her second son, Oliver. It was a difficult delivery with frequent episodes of vomiting. Oliver is waking frequently in the night at the moment for feeds and so Helena is feeling very tired.    Helena is taking lamotrigine 75mg twice a day   and we discussed taking more of the medication. Helena was happy to continue taking the 75mg twice a day as she now thinks the medication is being absorbed better that the vomiting has stopped.

Anabelle LewisD.O.B:1/03/1993 102, Swansea Road, Upper Tontown, Swansea SA98 2EK  Miss Lewis was reviewed in the Neurology clinic today via telephone consultation. She was referred from General Practice, after being identified as taking sodium valproate as part of the Prevent programme. She is a 27-year-old female who was diagnosed with Epilepsy at the age of 18 whilst living in London. She had two unprovoked generalised seizures, and was trialled on multiple anti-epileptic drugs including Levetiracetam, Lamotrigine, and Carbamazepine which were either ineffective or caused side-effects. Once commenced on sodium valproate 400mg twice daily,   she has had no further seizures  . She does not experience any significant side-effects and takes the medication reliably. Her MRI brain and EEG were normal at the time of diagnosis. There is no other significant past medical history, and she does not take any other regular medications. There is no relevant family history. We discussed the Prevent programme and the need to take reliable effective contraception whilst taking Sodium Valproate, due to the risk of side-effects to the developing baby should she become pregnant. Miss Lewis has a partner and is sexually active but has the IM Depo Provera via her GP. She understands the importance of maintaining this and to inform us if there are any changes or if she plans to become pregnant. With her permission I have completed the Prevent programme form to reflect these circumstances and we will review her on an annual basis. Plan 1.   Continue Sodium Valproate 400mg twice daily   2.

His epilepsy started at the age of 3 years. He has nocturnal generalised tonic clonic seizures which are associated with mild learnind difficulties. He has symptomatic epilepsy. EEGs in the past have shown sharpened waveforms in the frontal leads. I do not have the results of his previous brain imaging.  His epilepsy has been stable over the last few years and he gets around 1   generlised tonic clonic seizur  e in his sleep per month. He has previously tried topiramate and phenytoin and   he is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day   and   carbamazepine 400mg twice a day  .  I suggest that he increases the carbamazepine by 200mg every two weeks until he is taking 600mg twice a day. If there is no improvement in his seizure frequency then we would consider a different anti-convulsant medication. He is not keen on epilepsy surgery at the moment.

We discussed today what the programme means for women with epilepsy taking Eplim. Charlene understands the risks and issues around this medication. She is not yet menopausal. She has had her family and does not want to have anymore children. She drives at the moment and does not want to jeopardise her driving status by changing her medication.   I will discuss her case with one of our consultant neurologists for their opinion. However she should not stop her epilim at this point and we will look into the prevent paperwork to make sure that everything is agreed.

She has been   seizure free   for more than five years. She only drinks a small amount of alcohol and doesn't take any recreational drugs.

She has previously had fairly frequent partial seizures and so we added levetiracetam to her   Lamictal  . She is currently taking   Lamictal   150mg BD and levetiracetam 1250 mg BD. Miss little feels that levetiracetam hasn't really   helped her seizures   and is probably made her mood feel worse. As you know she's previously had episodes of depression.

Presently she is on Levetiracetam 1 gram in the morning, 750 mg nocte and   Lamotrigine   75 mg twice a day.  Since last October she had 4   generalised tonic clonic seizures   and some minor episodes. Her generalised seizures come without any warning. She says she usually falls to the floor, becomes stiff with minor shakes for approximately a minute. Her eyes are open. Occasionally she may have a tongue bite. Post ictal confusion lasts approximately 10 minutes.  Mrs Queen also complains of developing ulcers in the mouth following a seizure. She also suffers with tingling in the legs. It comes on at night when she retires to bed.  Comments:  1. Mrs Queen has long-standing intractable epilepsy. Her CT scan in the past was normal. She needs some up-to-date investigations and I'm referring her for an MRI scan of the brain and an EEG.   2. The night time tingling is suggestive of restless leg syndrome. She could try Ropinirole 0.5 mg nocte, increasing to 1 mg after 2 weeks.  4. Her dose of Levetiracetam should be increased by 250 mg so that she takes 1 gram twice a day. Her   Lamotrigine   should remain unchanged.

Symptomatic epilepsy presenting withfocal motor seizures with secondary generalised tonic clonic   seizures   2. AVM  Medication:1.   Levetiracetam 500mg bd   2.   Carbamazepine 300mg bd    Thank you for referring this sixty-six year old retired school master to my epilepsy clinic.  The history is that he suffered a haemorrhage in 2006 from an arteriovenous malformation. This was treated with radiosurgery. Soon after that he started having seizures and had been under the care of my collegue.    His epilepsy was well controlled until last December when he had a   seizure   whilst out walking. Currently his seizures occur 2 to 3 times per month. There is usually a warning in the form of twitching in his left hand and then the episode progresses to a tonic clonic convulsion.   He says that in his last episode, two weeks ago, he suffered a cut to his forehead, he was alone at the time. He lives with his wife who usually can assist him after a seizure.   His neurological examination today was normal.   There is some room to increase his medication to achieve better control of his epilepsy. I suggest that his Carbamazepine is increased to 400mg bd. I also think that in the light of his seizures returning we should update CT brain scan, and I am requesting the same.

She was accompanied to the clinic by her sister. For the last six month she has been having possible seizures. She says she gets a feeling of detachment which is followed by blacking out. Her sister reported that there is some jerking of her arms and legs and some frothing of the mouth. When she comes around, she feels tired and confused. She says it takes up to 2 hours to fully get back to normal. Current frequency of the   seizures   is once or twice a month, but last month there was a   cluster   of 3 in a single day and she was taken to A&E. There is also a history of staring episodes which last up to 2 minutes. They occur 3 to 5 times a week.   Ms Underwood lives with her partner who is often away. Her sister has been staying with them since February. There is no family history of note. She is not aware of having suffered febrile   seizures   in her childhood or any serious infections. There is no history of head injuries. Ms Underwood is currently not working but she volunteers in a charity shop. She stopped driving. There was some history of alcohol abuse, but she said she now only drinks occasionally, and not at all since starting treatment. She is a non-smoker.

I suggest we start her on Levetiracetam 250mg od increasing by 250mg increments weekly until she reaches 500mg bd. Once her   seizures   are controlled   Sodium Valproate   should be reduced to nil gradually.   She has been advices on safety at home and lifestyle issues.

The formed consist of an olfactory aura, followed by her staring blankly and not responding. There is some lip smacking and she recovers after a few minutes but feels tired after. The latter are different and consist of asynchronous shaking with retained awareness which fluctuates in frequency and intensity over anything up to 30 minutes, Her and her family are aware of the differences.   We discussed the following:  1. I think she is suffering a mixture of focal impaired awareness   seizures   and dissociative   seizures  . Both have been captured on EEG in the past. I have asked her if she could try and get one of her family members to video some of her attacks and send it through to the above secure e-mail advice line for us to review and advise about medication. 3.Given the combination of medications that she is taking, it is important that she knows to avoid pregnancy 4.I have left the appointment open and she knows to contact us via the open access service as and when she needs any advice.

Mr Harris was very open to this and was happy to reduce and stop his lamotrigine by 25mg every fortnight.

DOB 18/02/1954  I reviewed this 52-year-old woman in clinic today, together with her husband. She was referred for ongoing management of her epilepsy and so I will recap her epilepsy history.  Mrs Lorenzo was born normally. She had one febrile   seizure   at the age of 3 years. She had a mild viral meningitis at the age of 18 years but has not had any encephalitis or significant head injuries.  She had three A-levels and studied law at university before going on to work as a paralegal. At the age of 32 she had a significant collapse and was found to have a sub-arachnoid haemorrhage due to a ruptured ACA aneurysm. This was treated with endovascular coiling. She possibly had one   seizure   at the time of the subarachnoid haemorrhage but was not started on medication as it was thought that this was an acute symptomatic seizures.  Three years later, at the age of 35 she had two episodes of transient loss of consciousness which were thought to be tonic-clonic seizures and she was diagnosed with epilepsy at the age of 36. Initially she was treated with phenytoin but this was switched to   levetiracetam   2 years ago. Currently she is taking 750mg twice a day of the   levetiracetam   and her last   seizure   was 2 years ago. She has returned to work and is driving. She lives with her husband and two sons. He youngest son had 2 febrile seizures and had childhood absence epilepsy although he is now   seizure   free. She doesn\u2019t smoke but drinks around 12 units of alcohol (6 cans of lager) a week.  Apart from the epilepsy she takes ramipril for hypertension and simvastatin for hypercolestrolaemia.  Mrs Lorenzo does find that she is very irritable and short tempered since starting the levetiracetam. This seems to be having an effect on her quality of life and she would be very keen to change this.  Her neurological examination today was essentially normal. Blood pressure was 126/67, her pulse was 68 and regular.  A recent CT scan on 3/7/2016 is degraded but the artefact from the coil but does show an area of gliosis in the right frontal lobe. An EEG from 1990 shows slow waves with ocassional right sided sharp waves.  I agree with the diagnosis of symptomatic structural epilepsy, secondary to the previous sub-arachnoid haemorrhage. Given the significant modd changes which are likely due to side effects of the   levetiracetam   I would suggest changing to brivetiracetam. This can be done with a straight switch to 75mg bd of the brivetiracetam. I went through the DVLA guideance on driving when switching medication.  I will review her in clinic in 6 months time and will ask for an epilepsy nurse review.

There was no obvious precipitant and Mr Francis has not forgotten to take his medication. He had an unusual, difficult to describe sensation before losing consciousness and shaking for about 2-3 minutes according to his wife. Sometimes it is difficult to tell whether he is having epileptic or dissociative (non-epileptic) seizures but I think on balance these do sound like epileptic seizures.

He has continued to have sterotyped focal seizures which consist of left arm jerking. He gets an associated difficult to describe feeling in his arm.

She has seen other neurologists in the past. She has been suffering from epilepsy since her birth.  At the moment she gets 2 types of seizures: 1. Blank episodes. These occur without warning can last for up to 5 minutes. She is unaware of her surroundings. These happen at least once per day. 2.   Grand mal seizure  s. These happen a few times a month. During these she will shake all over. She occasionally will bite the side of her tongue.   She has tried sodium valproate in the past but stopped this because of tremor and gum problems. She also tried levetiracetam but stopped this because of mood problems.    Currently she takes clobazam 20mg bd   and   lamotrigine 175mg bd  . Her co-morbidities include depression and chronic pain syndrome. She takes pregabalin and MST for the pain.  She was told that she was born unexpectedly outside hospital and was still born. I do not have any other information about this with me today. Previous EEGs and MRIs have been normal. She has not had any significant head injuries or febriles seizures. There is no history of epilepsy in the family.  IN the first instance I have requested an up to date EEG and I will also review her old medical notes.

She has previously seen other epilepsy consultants and the epilepsy nurse. As you know she was diagnosed with epilepsy in 2012 following a severe traumatic brain injury where she fell down 12 flights of stairs, had traumatic contusions and a tramatuic sub dural haemorrhage. Last year she had around 15   generalised tonic clonic seizure  s. She is also having small attacks where she stares, has speech arrest and may smack her lips. I think that these are complex partial seizures. She is currently taking levetiracetam 1250mg twice a day. She gets chronic daily headache and takes at least 8 co-codamol tablets a day to try and help with this.  As you know Alice used to work as a teaching assistant and is very keen to return to work in the long term. She wants to get better seizure control to achieve this. It seems like Alice\u2019s epilepsy control is suboptimal. She still has some mood problems and so I would not increase the levetiracetam more. Please can you start lamotrigine 25mg once a day increasing by 25mg every fortnight until she is taking 100mg bd. This should help both the epilepsy and mood.

Her seizures began last year. Joan does not really remember what happens during a seizure. She has been told that she sees sees things that aren\u2019t there and her speech is not normal.  David says that she seems to panic, she may move her arms around start talking abnormally. After an event she will be confused and need to sleep. We discussed her diagnosis today in some detail. Her MRI has been reported as normal and she is awaiting an appointment for an EEG.  There are lots of resources available to help explain epilepsy in the family .We briefly discussed SUEDEP. We discussed that sharing a bed reduces the risk of SUDEP.  Joan says the   seizure   frequency is roughly every 4 weeks at present. We explained that this will become less over time as the medication is increased. She tells us that the Lamotrigine has helped her recover after seizures. She has a good support network, however her family are some distance away. Daniel is currently working from home and he is there to support her and the children. We also discussed contraception and I explained that the depo injection and lamotrigine can interact.  Another thing we discussed today is Joan\u2019s mood. She has had a low mood for several years and has previously been prescribed sertraline. We discussed today how depression is common in epilepsy. We have advised today that it would be beneficial to consider an anti-depressant she feels in the past the sertraline was not of much use. Please could you arrange to her in regards to her mental health.  We have also explained to Joan that we run an open access service and we will not send her a routine follow up appointment with the epilepsy nurses.

She also gets focal motor seizures where her right arm will twitch continually, sometimes for up to 5 hours.  In the past Jennifer has tried carbamazepine and vigabatrin. She is mostly independent but does need some help in terms of looking after her finances etc from her parents.  Jenny is normally seen by the other team and so I will not make any changes to her medication but would only be too happy to readvise/reassess should the need arise. ```.\n\nExtract the Prescription only from the clinical text in JSON format. \n\nGive me the output in the json format as mentioned below, delimited by triple quotes\n```{'start_index': '<value for start_index>', 'end_index': '<value for end_index>', 'text': '<value for text>', 'attributes': {'DrugDose': '<value for DrugDose>', 'DrugName': '<value for DrugName>', 'DoseUnit': '<value for DoseUnit>', 'Frequency': '<value for Frequency>'}}```.\n\n", "output": {"start_index": "520", "end_index": "539", "text": "generalised seizure", "attributes": {"UpperNumberOfSeizures": "4", "TimePeriod": "Month", "LowerNumberOfSeizures": "3", "NumberOfTimePeriods": "1"}}}{"instruction": "Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text\n\nBelow is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.\nclinical text: ```Clinic date 12/04/2018  Re: Ms Rachel Smith  Medical diagnosis:Generalised epilepsy with   absences   and GTCS  Medication  Lamotrigine  100 mg in the morning   Levetiracetam   250mg twice a day (increase by 250mg every fortnight to 500mg twice a day)  I met with Rachel and her mother today in clinic.

Jason has been having some problems with anxiety recently and I note that you have started him on sertraline for this which seems to have helped a bit. In terms of his epilepsy, things are relatively stable. His sister (who was with him in clinic today) said that he has had around 5   seizures   in the last year which is good for him. Jason gets focal   seizures   with altered awareness where he will have an abnormal sensation on the right side of his body and then find it difficult to talk. He might pick at his clothes during these according to his sister.  We had a chat about the cause of his epilepsy which happened because of his nasty encephalitis infection a few years ago (herpes encephalitis). We discussed various treatment options and it may be worth increasing the carbamazepine slightly to help with the   seizures   and the anxiety. I would increase it to 600mg in the morning and 400mg in the evening and then to 600mg bd after a few weeks if tolerated.

We had a discussion about changing the medication or withdrawing the medication completely. Simon knows about the seizure reoccurrence risk of reducing his medication and the fact that he would need to stop driving for six months whilst this is taking place. He wonders whether the tiredness is something to do with his carbamazepine although I note that this is long standing.  I would recommend not making any changes. If however, Simon was keen to change the medication int he future then I would suggest introducing lamotrigine at 25mg once a day, increasing by 25mg every fortnight, aiming 75mg bd.

Her Mother confirmed that she is fully conscious during the episodes and in fact is able to communicate.  Her EEG showed some minor temporal slowing but otherwise was reported as normal.

We discussed the importance of  good drug compliance.  She reports that she had been stressed recently with her work and her studies. She has been asked to do extra shifts at work which then affects her course work and makes her stressed. She previously reported a sleep related movement disorder and we discussed this again today.
