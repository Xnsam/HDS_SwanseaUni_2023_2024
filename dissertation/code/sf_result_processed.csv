clinical text: ```Clinic date 25/09/2018  Re Mr Owen Owens30/06/1968  Dear doctor,  Diagnosis: Symptomatic structural focal epilepsy Area of ischaemic damage left inferior frontal lobe Significant anxiety and depression  I reviewed this 50 year old man, together with his wife, in clinic today. He was well from an epilepsy point of view until he had a   seizur  e last month. His wife heard a bang from the next room and went in to see him unconsciouss on the floor. He was stiff, his eyes were open and he made unusual groaning noises before starting to shake. This lasted about 40 seconds before he went to a “deep sleep”. It took him several hours to recover fully. Mr Owens himself remembers his right leg twitching before he lost consciousness. I think therefore that this was a   focal to bilateral convulsive   seizur    es. As you recall Mr Owens has had focal motor   seizur  es in the past where he has had jerking of his right leg. These were happening frequently before he started the medication. The last event was probably 10 months ago. He has had one previous   focal to bilateral convulsive   seizur    e at the time of diagnosis of his epilepsy in May 2017. As you will recall his MRI at the time was abnormal with an area of ischaemic damage in the left inferior frontal lobe. This is the probable cause of his epilepsy. An EEG in 2017 did show some left sided sharp waves.    He is currently taking lamotrigine 75mg twice a day   and given the recent   seizur  e I would be very grateful if you could increase this by 25mg every fortnight to 100mg twice a day. It can be increased further if necessary in a similar way. Previously he tried levetiracetam but this made his mood worse.  Mr Owens has ongoing problems with his mood and finds it very difficult to leave the house. He has found anti-depressants useful in the past and I would be very grateful if you could reassess him from his mental health point of view. There is no contraindication to treatment with anti-depressants if necessary. Mr Owens is still managing to work as an accountant and he is aware of the DVLA driving regulations. He is currently drinking around 40units of alcohol a week. We had a chat about the effects of alcohol and I would advise that he reduces his intake to the recommended 14 units of alcohol per week with a few alcohol free days. I will ask the epilepsy nurses to review again. Yours  ```.

clinical text: ```Diagnosis: Refractory epilepsy  Medication: Levetiracetam 1250mg bd    Lamotrigine 100mg bd    I reviewed this woman today in clinic. Since increasing the levetiracetam there has been no change in her   seizure   frequency. She has around 3-5 seizure  s   a week.  In June her lamotrigine level was measured and was slightly high. She had a rash at the time but I am not sure if the lamotrigine caused this as she has been taking lamotrigine for several years. Her mood is not brilliant and she is finding that she is sleeping a lot in the day whilst being awake during the night.  We talked about some treatment options. I would advise switching the levetiracetam to brivetiracetam (100mg bd) this would be a straight switch. We also discussed some sleep hygiene measures and I have included a leaflet on some advice on sleeping. Also I would be grateful if you could prescribe melatonin 8mg on for 6 weeks to see if that improves the sleep cycle  ```.

clinical text: ```Diagnosis Focal epilepsy, probable occipital lobe onset MRI negative  Medication:   Zonismaide   100mg bd   Brivitiracetam   50mg bd  I reviewed this 48 year old lady together with her husband in clinic today. She has a complicated epilepsy history and I did not have the full medical notes with me today and so I will need to review those. She was born slightly prematurely at 34 weeks but had a normal development. Her   seizure  s started at the age of 11 and have continued ever since. Previous MRI scans have been normal although some EEGs have shown a probable left occipital lobe focus.  Currently she is getting around 1   seizure   per day. Her normal   seizure  s consist of coloured blobbs in the right side of her version. She might stare and be unresponsive later for a few minutes. About once a month she will have a   secondary generalised   seizure which start like her normal   seizure   but then will progress to involve loss of consciousness with limb shaking.  She also has asthma and hypertensions. She lives with her husband and 4 year old son. CUrrently she is working part time as a cleaner. She smoker 10 menthol cigarettes a day and enjoys a tot of rum and blackcurrant in the evening.  Her neurological examination was normal  Impression it does seem that this lady has a drug refractory focal (occipital lobe) epilepsy.  Plan I will review her old notes I think it worthwhile having an up to date MRI and EEG which I will request I would suggest increasing the briviteracetam by 25mg every two weeks to a maximum of 100mg twice a day. In the future we can consider an increase in the lamotrigine I will review her in clinic in around 3 months time  ```.

As you know he had 3 febrile seizures between the ages of 3 and 5 and then started developing focal onset seizures from the age of 6. They continued until his surgery a few years ago. I was very pleased to note that he remains   seizure free   after his surgery. Before the surgery he was having seizures several times a week despite having tried many medications which have included carbmazapine, levetiracetam and zonisamide. The lamotrigine has had the most effect of the years and he has tolerated this medication the best.  He was born normally and had a normal development having left school with three A-levels. I am pleased to note that he has returned to his job with the insurance company and has also started driving lessons.  We had a discussion about the medication and that any reduction in the medication runs the risk of seizure reoccurance. At the moment Mr Williams is happy to continue to take the medication as he does not have any side effects.  Yours  ```.

As you know he had 3 febrile seizures between the ages of 3 and 5 and then started developing focal onset seizures from the age of 6. They continued until his surgery a few years ago. I was very pleased to note that he remains   seizure free   after his surgery. Before the surgery he was having seizures several times a week despite having tried many medications which have included carbmazapine, levetiracetam and zonisamide. The lamotrigine has had the most effect of the years and he has tolerated this medication the best.  He was born normally and had a normal development having left school with three A-levels. I am pleased to note that he has returned to his job with the insurance company and has also started driving lessons.  We had a discussion about the medication and that any reduction in the medication runs the risk of seizure reoccurance. At the moment Mr Williams is happy to continue to take the medication as he does not have any side effects.  Yours  ```.

His baseline has been around one or two seizures per year. Things have got a bit worse recently and he is having one or two seizures per month. He now does not get a warning that the seizures are going to happen although he previously did get an unusual deja-vu sensation.  He has tried higher doses of lamotrigine in the past but this has caused more tiredness. We had a chat today about adding in another medication and I would be grateful if you could start Levetiracetam. Generally it is well tolerated but can cause tiredness and mood change in higher doses. Please can you prescribe 250mg once a day increasing by 250mg every fortnight to an initial target dose of 500mg twice a day.  As you know he had a MRI scan in 2014 which was normal apart from a few scattered tiny hyperintensities. An EEG last year showed some non-specific slowing in both frontal regions. As before I have asked John to keep a careful eye on his blood sugars to make sure that he is not having hypoglycaemic events. I will request an up to date EEG and review him with the results. ```.

"Your task is to extract prescription information from a clinical text

Below is the clinical notes from a doctor, delimited by triple quotes.
clinical text: ```Further to my last letter Mr Rees’ epilepsy is reasonably controlled on   phenobarbitone   100mg twice a day as well as Epilim 300mg twice a day. He is getting around 2   seizures   per month at the moment which is good for him as previously he has had several   seizures   per week.  However, he is getting some side effects of drowsiness and difficulty concentrating. The   phenobarbitone   level was on the higher side of normal. I think that it would sensible to start a new medication instead of the   phenobarbitone   and so please can you start lamotrigine 25mg once a day increasing by 25mg every month. At the same time please reduce the   phenobarbitone   by 50mg every month.  I will see him again in clinic, but I will also make sure that the gets an appointment with the epilepsy nurses soon. ```.
